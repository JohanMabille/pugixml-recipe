about:
    description: 'pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like
        interface

        with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser
        which

        constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation

        for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available,
        with

        Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings

        (which happen automatically during parsing/saving)
